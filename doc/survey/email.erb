Subject: How do you use pull requests?


Hi there, <%= if name.nil? or name.empty? then login else name end %>!

As part of a research team at TU Delft in the Netherlands, I am looking for
active GitHub users for a survey. We are interested on how people do distributed
software development through pull requests. Through my data, I noticed you are
among the top pull request <%= role %> for the Github repository <%= repo %>.

Here's a link to the survey: 
  <%= link %> 

Filling in the survey should take about 10 minutes. I would greatly appreciate
your input -- it will help us understand how modern developers actually work and
in turn might help shape new tools that support developers. We will openly
publish the results so everyone can benefit from them, but will anonymize
everything before doing so. As a thank you note, you might want to have a look
at this report of your project's community openess: 
  <%= perflink %>

This is a purely academic study. We're not affiliated with GitHub in any way.
If you consider this email to be spam, I'm very sorry, but this really was not
our intention! There will be no follow-up. 

You can find more about our research on pull requests through the following links:

Thanks in advance,
